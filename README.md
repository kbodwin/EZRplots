## Installation


## Function 1
The first function will create a chloropleth map for the user. The user will input the data set they wish to use for the map, which will have 2 columns: the names of their designated region and the variable of interest. The user will then specify which map they wish to display: whether it is all the countries, the states, global regions, etc. The user will have the option to specify additional parameters stating the units of their variable, how many bins for the legend they wish to create, etc. The function will return the resulting cloropleth map altered to the users' desires.
