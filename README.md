# EZRplots
 A package that provides shortcuts for making elegant plots

## Installation


## Function 1
The first function will create a chloropleth map for the user. The user will input the data set they wish to use for the map, which will have 2 columns: the names of their designated region and the variable of interest. The user will then specify which map they wish to display: whether it is all the countries, the states, global regions, etc. The user will have the option to specify additional parameters stating the units of their variable, how many bins for the legend they wish to create, etc. The function will return the resulting cloropleth map altered to the users' desires.

## easy_plot_ly
This is a shortcut function to help generate 2D or 3D plots with plot_ly. The user will input their data and the variables they want for the x, y, and z axes. The user will be able to specify the type of plot they want to generate from severa basic options like scatter, line, surface, 3d_density, mesh, or an autogenerated plot. Addtional helper functions are available to add a 3D regression plane and another to change the plot aesthetics.
